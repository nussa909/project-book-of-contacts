 PyContacts is a personal assistant for managing contacts and notes, developed as part of a team educational project within the Python Programming course.

# Features
The personal assistant is developed with a command-line interface. It saves data to disk, so it is not lost after a restart. The prompt_toolkit library is used for handling inputs and prompts, while rich is used to provide a user-friendly interface.

**The personal assistant can**

+ Save contacts with names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, and birthdays.

+ Show upcoming birthdays (e.g., within 7 days).

+ Validate names, addresses, Ukrainian phone numbers, emails during input.

+ Save, search (strict, non-strict), edit, and delete contacts.

+ Save, search notes by tags, edit, and delete notes.

+ Add "tags" to notes.
